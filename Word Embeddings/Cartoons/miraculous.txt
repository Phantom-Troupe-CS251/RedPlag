    [In] modern-day Paris, Marinette and Adrien are two high school kids with a difference: 
they are the chosen ones to save Paris from evil! They have been entrusted with an important mission – to capture akumas, 
creatures responsible for turning normal people into super-baddies. When involved in such adventures, these two school kids become superheroes:
 Marinette transforms into Ladybug and Adrien becomes Cat Noir. But Ladybug and Cat Noir do not know each other’s true identity.
 Marinette is unaware that, beneath the Cat Noir costume nestles Adrien, her secret crush. Similarly, Adrien doesn’t know that Ladybug is,
 in actual fact, just Marinette - one of the girls in his class.[8]
