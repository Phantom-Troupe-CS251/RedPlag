### Instructions to run the backend:
1. cd to this ./backend/ (i.e. the folder that contains this readme file)
2. source env/bin/activate    (run this to activate the virtual environment)
3. pip install -r requirements.txt   (Do this for the first time you run the virtual environment to install all the dependencies)
4. Whenever you install a dependency for the backend run: pip freeze > requirements.txt before commiting you work so that others donn't face clashes.
5. To deactivate the virtual environment after your work run: deactivate
